#H1 On the Influence of Dynamic Motion in Perception of Translucency

#H2 Abstract
Translucent materials are ubiquitous in the real world, from organic materials such as food or human skin, to synthetic materials like plastic or rubber. While multiple models for translucent materials exist, understanding how we perceive translucent appearance, and how it is affected by illumination and geometry, remains an open problem. In this work, we analyze how well human observers estimate the density of translucent objects for static and dynamic illumination scenarios. Interestingly, our results suggest that dynamic illumination may not be critical to assess the nature of translucent materials.

#H2 Introduction
The project revolves on running a user-study experiment in which we ask users to complete a task. The user-interface used in the experiment can be found in the folder "website_interface". In the folder "user_data_experimen" we provide the raw and processed data gathered by the user-study experiment.

## Folder Description
There are 2 php files:
* 'website_interface.php' holds all the data used to run the pshycophysical experiment. 
* 'user_data_experiment' is where the data from the users are stored, in the experiment we initially asked to 13 participants, but in the only we collected data only for 12 of them, hence that's why it's missing user ID 7.
